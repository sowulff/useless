# Code Review by Sophie Wulff

1. `java.js:17-19` - These const-names all starts with the word java, that dosen't feel necessary.
2. `index.html:33` - On width 635-720 the container-text jumps out from the frame.
3. `index.html:22` - On width 720-830 the h1 gets a position over the first frame.
4. `java.js:23-29` - Instead of using innerHTML you can use text-Content.
5. `java.js:27-29` - The const-names randomElement and javaContainer could be more clearly.

Really good job with the first javaScript-website, I like the flying cat that plays music on click!
